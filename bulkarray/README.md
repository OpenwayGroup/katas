Implement the *BulkArray* interface according to its Javadoc so that *BulkArrayTest* passes.

Pay attention to computational complexity specified in the Javadoc.

Keep in mind, that all system commands for copying, filling, creating and freeing memory arrays are not *O(1)*.

Memory leaks are prohibited as well :)
